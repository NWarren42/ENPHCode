<h2>Nested Selection Structures</h2>

<p>You can also use selection structures <strong>inside</strong> of other
selection structures, which can significantly increase the complexity of our
programs. This task will use a nested selection structure to "spin" though
the letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>The <strong>letter</strong> variable holds the starting letter, while the
<strong>move</strong> variable equals the number of letters we have to spin
through to get to the final letter. If we go beyond 'Z', the program should
loop back to 'A'.</p>

<p>Begin by writing an if-else block that uses the condition that the int
<strong>move</strong> is between 1 and 25 inclusive. Inside this loop, we want to
perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul>Add the value of <strong>move</strong> to <strong>letter</strong>. Keep
in mind that letters are stored numerically!</ul>

<ul>Check whether the <strong>new</strong> value for letter has <strong>surpassed
</strong> the numerical value of 'Z'. If true, <strong>subtract 26</strong>
from the value of <strong>letter</strong> to loop back to 'A'.</ul>

<p>If you get stuck, see the hints below. When done correctly, the updated value
for letter will be <strong>'D'</strong>.</p>

<div class="hint">
  if(move is greater than 0 && move is less than 26) { add move to letter; ... }
</div>

<div class="hint">
  if(letter is greater than 'Z') { subract 26 from letter }
</div>

<p>As always, experimentation is encouraged. </p>
