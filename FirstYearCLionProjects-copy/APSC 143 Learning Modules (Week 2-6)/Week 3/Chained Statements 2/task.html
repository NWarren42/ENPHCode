<h2>Chained If-Else Statements</h2>

<p>Chained if-else blocks can be useful in testing a single variable for equality
to multiple values. This example will help you learn how to write these blocks.</p>

<p>The example code uses a char called <strong>fruit</strong> to determine which
fruit has been requested. Write an <strong>if-else chain</strong> that tests whether
the char fruit is equal to the following values: <strong>'a', 'b', 'g', or
'm'</strong>.</p>

<ul>If <strong>'a'</strong> is equal, output: <strong>Apples</strong></ul>
<ul>If <strong>'b'</strong> is equal, output: <strong>Bananas</strong></ul>
<ul>If <strong>'g'</strong> is equal, output: <strong>Grapefruit</strong></ul>
<ul>If <strong>'m'</strong> is equal, output: <strong>Mangoes</strong></ul>
<ul>Otherwise, output: <strong>Fresh out of fruit</strong></ul>

<p>Don't forget the new line character! If you get stuck, see the hints below. These
chain structures are very useful as a menu program when used in tandem with the
<strong>scanf</strong> function. In the next task, we'll go over a way to write these
blocks differently.</p>

<div class="hint">
  if(fruit == 'a') { print Apples }
</div>

<div class="hint">
  else if(fruit == 'b') { print Bananas }
</div>
