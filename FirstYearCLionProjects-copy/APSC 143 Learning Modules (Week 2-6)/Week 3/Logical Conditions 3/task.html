<h2>Logical Conditions</h2>

<h3>The AND Operator</h3>

<p>The AND operator, written in code as <strong>&&</strong>, is
useful in situations where we want <strong>all</strong> our required
conditions to evaluate as <strong>true</strong>. This task will display how
a condition using this operator works.</p>

<p>Using the code from the last task, add to the condition for the variable z
such that <strong>both values</strong> for x and y must be <strong>positive
</strong> (for this example, 0 is a positive number) in addition to the previous
condition - that y is greater than the doubled value of x.</p>

<p>Remember that you can use as many AND operators in a condition as necessary!
If you need help, see the hint below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  (previous condition) && x must be greater than -1 && y must be greater than -1
</div>

<p>As always, you are encouraged to enter different values for x and y to see
how the condition evaluates differently.</p>
