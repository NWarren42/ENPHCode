<h2>Logical Conditions</h2>

<p>As seen in the previous task, logical conditions can be assigned to int type
variables to be evaluated. Here, we have another, simpler version.</p>

<p>To complete this task, you need to create a logical expression that will
evaluate <strong>true</strong> when y is <strong>larger than</strong> double
the value of x. If you get stuck, check the hint below.</p>

<div class="hint">
    y <strong> > </strong> (x doubled)
</div>

<p>Keep in mind how simply we could change the expression to have y <strong>
greater or equal to</strong> the doubled value of x, or even have this condition
evaluate to false (using the <strong>!</strong> operator). You are encouraged to
try different values for x and y to see how the condition evaluates in different
situations.</p>
