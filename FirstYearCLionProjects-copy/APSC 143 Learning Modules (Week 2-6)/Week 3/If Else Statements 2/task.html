<h2>If and If-Else Statements</h2>

<p>The provided code asks for an input of a car's speed, which will be used
to determine the conditional output. For this task, write an <strong>if-else
statement</strong> that uses the condition that the speed must be between
<strong>0 and 100</strong> km/h, inclusive.</p>

<p>If the speed is within these bounds, output: <strong>Travelling at
(speed) km/h.</strong> Replace the (speed) with the user's float value, to 2
decimal places.</p>

<p>Otherwise, output: <strong>Hey, you can't do that!</strong></p>

<p>Remember to use the new line character, and the escape character for the
second printf function! The code contained in the else
block will run only when the condition for the <strong>if statement
</strong> is <strong>false</strong>.If you get stuck, take a look at the
hints below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  if(speed is between 0 and 100) { first printf function }
</div>

<div class="hint">
  else { second printf function }
</div>

<p>To complete this task, enter a speed value that is <strong>outside</strong>
the bounds. As always, you are encouraged to experiment with the code.</p>
