<h2>Switch-Case Statements</h2>

<p>A chain that tests a single variable for equality can be written using a
<strong>switch-case</strong> statement instead. Note that switch-case statements
can only be used for this purpose, and cannot evaluate other logical
expressions.</p>

<p>This example code is identical in use to the last task's if-else-if chain,
but is simpler to read as each case clearly displays what option it represents.
However, it is missing an important component. Try running the program to see what
might be wrong.</p>

<p>To complete the task, add the missing component. If you are stuck, try the hint
below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  Following cases can be skipped using a <strong>break</strong> command.
</div>

<p>While cleaner, switch-case statements cannot do anything that a well-made if-else-if
chain cannot do. Therefore, they are optional.</p>
