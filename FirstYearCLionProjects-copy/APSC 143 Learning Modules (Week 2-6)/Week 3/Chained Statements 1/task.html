<h2>Chained If-Else Statements</h2>

<p>We can check for multiple conditions individually using a <strong>
chained if-else block</strong>. Each statement of the block is treated
as its own if statement and run if true; however, only the code contained
in the <strong>first</strong> true statement will run. The rest of the 
statements will be skipped. Let's code one for ourselves to see how it
works!</p>

<p>The example code uses a basic if-else block that you will add statements
to. Between the if and the else blocks, write an <strong>else if</strong>
statement with the condition that the <strong>difference</strong> between x
and y is <strong>5 or less</strong>. Remember that y must be at least as large
as x if this condition is being checked! Inside this block, output the following
statement:</p>

<p><strong>y is a little larger than x.</strong></p>

<p>Then, add another <strong>else if</strong> statement <strong>after</strong>
the one you just wrote. This one has the condition that the difference between
x and y is <strong>50 or less</strong>. Inside this block, output the following
statement:</p>

<p><strong>y is significantly larger than x.</strong></p>

<p>If you get stuck, check the hints below. Do you know which printf function
will execute?</p>

<div class="hint">
  else if(difference <= 5) { output 1 }
</div>

<div class="hint">
  else if(difference <= 50) { output 2 }
</div>

<p>Consider the <strong>order</strong> in which we wrote the else if conditions.
Since the third condition <strong>contains</strong> the second (ie. any number
that is less than 6 is also less than 51), we have to check for the <strong>more
specific</strong> condition first. Otherwise, the larger condition would evaluate
true <strong>before</strong> the smaller condition could even be checked! Try
reordering the conditions to see for yourself.</p>
    
<p>Feel free to check different values for x and y, and keep in mind
that we can have any number of statements in the chain. Also, the else at the
end is optional and used when you want a catch-all for any conditions that
fail everything else.</p>
