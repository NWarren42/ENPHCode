<h2>Logical Conditions</h2>

<p>Welcome to week 3! The main concepts we will be exploring are logical
conditions, selection structures, chained structures, and nested structures.
</p>

<p>Logical conditions & expressions are extremely helpful in comparing some
variables to others, to see if a variable meets a set of requirements, and
a variety of other situations.</p>

<p>The example code shows a relatively large logical expression, which the
program evaluates and prints the result: a <strong>1</strong> if true, or a
<strong>0</strong> if false. Try running the code and see what the result
is. Do you agree with the computer?</p>
