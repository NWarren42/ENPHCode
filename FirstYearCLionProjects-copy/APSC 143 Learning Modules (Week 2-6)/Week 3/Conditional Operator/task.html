<h2>Conditional Operator</h2>

<p>The conditional operator, <strong>?</strong>, can be used in place of an if-else
block for single-code-line options, or to assign values or expressions to variables
based on a logical condition.</p>

<p>For this task, code has been provided for the user to enter any
integer. Write a <strong>conditional operator statement</strong> that
will determine whether the entered integer is <strong>even</strong> or
<strong>odd</strong>. Then, do one of the following:</p>

<ul>If <strong>even</strong>, print: <strong>x is even</strong></ul>
<ul>If <strong>odd</strong>, print: <strong>x is odd</strong></ul>

<p>To complete the task, enter an odd integer when prompted (using the Run tab).</p>

<p>See the hint below if you get stuck. As seen in the lectures, you
can also use this operator to assign one of two values or expressions
to a variable. However, this is only an alternative to an if-else
statement and so is optional.</p>

<div class="hint">
  (remainder of x / 2 is zero) ? even print command : odd print command;
</div>
