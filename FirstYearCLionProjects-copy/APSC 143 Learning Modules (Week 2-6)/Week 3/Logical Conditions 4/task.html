<h2>Logical Conditions</h2>

<h3>The OR Operator</h3>

<p>The OR operator, written as <strong>||</strong>, is similar to the AND
operator with a key difference: it evaluates true if <strong>at least one
</strong> of the logical expressions evaluates to <strong>true</strong>.
Therefore, it will evaluate to true no matter how many false conditions are
present, so long as there is at least one condition that is true.</p>

<p>Using the example code, write a new logical expression that will evaluate
to true if <strong>any</strong> of the following conditions are true:</p>

<ul>The value for y is <strong>less than or equal to</strong> the value for x.</ul>
<ul>The value for y is a negative number.</ul>
<ul>The value for x is a negative number.</ul>

<p>For this task, 0 is a positive value. If you get stuck, take a look at the
hint below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  y is less than or equal to x || y is less than 0 || x is less than 0
</div>

<p>As always, you are encouraged to experiment with the conditions and values to
see what changes. Furthermore, think about how the AND operator and the OR
operator could be used simultaneously!</p>
