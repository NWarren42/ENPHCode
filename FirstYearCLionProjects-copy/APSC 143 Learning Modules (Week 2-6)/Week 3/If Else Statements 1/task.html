<h2>If and If-Else Statements</h2>

<p>If statements provide a direct use for logical expressions: as
    a condition that determines whether certain lines of code will be
    executed. By using these statements, we can allow our programs to
    respond to different conditions in different ways!</p>

<p>The example code shows a simple if-else block that will run a different
printf function based on the integers input by the user. If the first value
entered is <strong>larger</strong>, then the condition will be <strong>false
</strong> and the second printf function will run. The opposite is true for
a larger second value. Remember that if there are multiple lines of code
contained in an if statement, curly brackets are needed.</p>

<p>Try running the code with different inputs and see what happens. Remember
that user input must be entered on the <strong>Run</strong> tab at the bottom.
Do you notice a flaw in the program? See the hint if you can't find it.</p>
