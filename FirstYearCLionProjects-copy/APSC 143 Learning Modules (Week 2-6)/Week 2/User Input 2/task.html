<h2>User Input Example</h2>

<h3>Multi-Variable User Input</h3>

<p>The <strong>scanf</strong> function can also be used to take multiple
values simultaneously by including multiple format specifiers inside the
double quotes. The format inside the quotes should match the format of the
input.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul><strong>56 4.7 -> is formatted as -> "%d %f"</strong></ul>
<ul><strong>p, 23.5 -> is formatted as -> "%c, %f"</strong></ul>

<p>Try updating the scanf statement from the previous example to read an int
followed by a char, separated by spaces. You will have to make a new variable
to hold the char value. Then, print them both in the following format:</p>

<p><strong>int = 35, char = 'u'</strong></p>

<p>In order to pass the output test, you will need to input the integer
<strong>35</strong> and the character <strong>'u'</strong> separated by spaces into
the <strong>Run</strong> tab below once you have started the Check operation. You are
encouraged to run your code using different inputs to test the
limitations of your program.</p>

<p>As always, print a new line character to include an empty line at the end
of your output. For assistance with the scanf input, see the below hint.</p>

<div class="hint">
    scanf("%d %c", &userInt, &userChar);
</div>
