<h2>First Program - Hello World</h2>

<p>Welcome to the APSC 143 interactive learning module! The module
is designed to give you step-by-step instructions on building
simple programs and learning the key concepts from the lecture
videos. While these tasks are optional, they are highly recommended
as programming is best learned through <strong>practice</strong>.</p>

<p>As you can see on the left hand directory, there are multiple tasks
for each week of the module. When you successfully complete a task,
The checkbox will turn green.</p>

<p>To begin, try running this "Hello World" program by using the
<strong>green play button</strong> on the left side of the code, clicking
the first option that appears. If all
goes well, you will see <strong>Hello, World!</strong> appear in the terminal
window at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>Clicking the <strong>Check</strong> below this text will mark down that you
have completed this task. However, most upcoming tasks will <strong>evaluate</strong>
the code you write to make sure you understand the concepts.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Code</h3>

<p>This program uses a few concepts that are critical to programming in
C. First, we use the <strong>main function</strong> to tell the
compiler what code we want executed, in the order we want it. Second,
we have an <strong>include</strong> statement, which tells the compiler
that we are using functions that are found in the <strong>stdio.h library,
</strong> such as <strong>printf</strong>. Keep in mind that the
<strong>return 0</strong> statement at the end of the program is optional
for the main function.</p>
