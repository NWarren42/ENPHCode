<h2>Float Type Variables</h2>

<p>This next task will help you use float type variables in programming and
in output statements using format specifiers.</p>

<p>Fill in the missing code so that it outputs the following, without
changing the initialized value:</p>

<p><strong>x = 6.845</strong></p>

<p>Remember to print a new line character, as always.</p>

<div class="hint">
  Float type variables use the format specifier <strong>%f</strong>. The
    number of decimal places can be specified by including ".[n]" between
    the '%' and the 'f', where n is the number of desired decimals.
