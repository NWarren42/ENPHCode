<h2>User Input</h2>

<p>Another important concept to programming is taking input from the user
    using the <strong>scanf</strong> function,
which allows code to run using different values each time. In this example,
the program allows the user to input an integer value, which is stored in
the variable <strong>userInt</strong> and output with the printf
function.</p>

<p>Make note of the key components of the scanf function: the format
specifiers and the variables preceded with the <strong>'&'</strong>
character. Try running the code and inputting different values to see how it
works. You can input a value in the <strong>Run</strong> tab at the bottom of
the screen by typing it into the terminal and pressing the Enter key.</p>
