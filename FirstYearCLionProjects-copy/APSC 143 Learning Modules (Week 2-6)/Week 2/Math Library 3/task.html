<h2>Math Library</h2>

<h3>Mathematical Constants</h3>

<p>The math library also includes some prominent mathematical constants that can
be used in place of defining our own. In this task, we'll use the most common
constant, pi.</p>

<p>The example code is trying to calculate the circumference of a circle with
the given radius of 3.2m. Complete the expression for circumference using the
constant for pi that is included in the math library. If done correctly, you
will get the following output:</p>

<p><strong>Circumference = 20.106</strong></p>

<p>See the below hint for some help with the constant. Keep in mind that we can
always define our own constants using <strong>#define</strong>!</p>
