<h2>Escape Character</h2>

<p>The new line character is a special use of the <strong>escape character</strong>,
which is represented by the backward slash character <strong>\</strong> . The
escape character is usually used to print characters that typically have other
purposes.</p>

<p>For example, since <strong>'\'</strong> is used as the escape character it cannot
be output in the usual way. This issue
can be avoided if we output it using the following format:</p>

<p><strong>"\\"</strong></p>

<p>For this task, write a prinf statement to output the following sentence:</p>

<p><strong>"Back to the Future" is a great movie.</strong></p>

<p>Remember that you will need to use the escape character to print the double
quotation marks. You will, as always, also need to include a new line character
at the end of the statement. See the hint below if you get stuck.</p>

  Double quotation marks can be printed using <strong>\"</strong> .
