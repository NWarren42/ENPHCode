<h2>Truncation</h2>

<p>As seen in the <strong>Expressions 2</strong> task, truncation can be a problem
when dealing with expressions. Make sure you are aware of areas in any program you
write where truncation might occur!</p>

<p>In the example code, there is a truncation issue. Make a change in the code
so that this issue is resolved. If done correctly, you should get the following
output:</p>

<p><strong>Value of z is 2.71</strong></p>

<p>The below hints show the two methods shown in lecture for
resolving truncation. Note that there is no Peek Solution for this task, as it can be
completed multiple ways. </p>

<div class="hint">
  Cast one of the variables to a float by adding <strong>(float)</strong> just
  before it.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Change one of the values (for example, the 4) into a float value.
</div>

<p>Once you complete this task, the console will print a password for you to
