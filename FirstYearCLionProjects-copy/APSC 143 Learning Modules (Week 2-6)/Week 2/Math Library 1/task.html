<h3>Mathematical Functions</h3>

<p>Now that we can use expressions effectively, we can use the math.h library to
access any number of mathematical computational functions to assist us in our
programming.</p>

<p>For this example, we'll use two of the more commonly used functions: the <strong>
exponent function</strong> and the <strong>sine function</strong>. Using the defined
float variable x, compute the cube and the sine of x. The following values should
appear:</p>

<p><strong>The cube of x is 199.18</strong></p>
<p><strong>The sine of x is -0.43</strong></p>

<p>If you need help with the functions, see the hints below. Remember that you need
to include the math library to access these functions!</p>

  Exponent function: pow(base, power)
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Sine function: sin(value)
</div>
