<h2>Prompted User Input</h2>

<p>Each coding assignment in this course will ask you to include a prompt for any user input;
meaning the program must print a statement asking for a desired input. This task will help
teach you how to design these prompts, identically to how it will be used in assignments.</p>

<p>Essentially, a prompt will be a print statement that specifies the requested variables that
will be read in the following scanf statement. In each assignment, the prompt <strong>does not
</strong> print a new line character, allowing the values to be input on the same line. Variables
will always be separated by spaces.</p>

<p>In this example, the program requires the height of a building in meters, and the number
of floors it contains. Write a prompt that outputs this line:</p>

<p><strong>Enter building height and number of floors: </strong></p>

<p>This prompt should also print a <strong>single space</strong> after the colon.</p>

<p>When you run the code and enter <strong>312.8</strong> and <strong>26</strong> separated by
spaces, you should get the following output and pass the output test:</p>

<p><strong>This building is 312.80m tall and has 26 floors.</strong></p>

<p>Once you have this code correct, you can use it in all of your assignments provided you update
it for the necessary values.</p>
