<h2>Expressions</h2>

<h3>Assignment Shorthands</h3>

<p>These operators are primarily used to make your code cleaner. Clean code
is good code!</p>

<p>Whenever you update a variable based on its previous value, you can use
these assignment shorthands: <strong>+=, -=, /=, *=, %=</strong>. As an example,
run the example code. You can see that x1 and x2 have the same value, because
they use identical operations. However, x2 uses an assignment shorthand and is a much
simpler expression.</p>

<p>Try to use these shorthands where you can; once you get used to them, they
become a great convenience.</p>
