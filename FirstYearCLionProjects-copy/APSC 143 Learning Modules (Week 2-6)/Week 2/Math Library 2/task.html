<h2>Math Library</h2>

<h3>Rounding Functions</h3>

<p>The math library also has built-in functions for rounding float values to an
integer: the <strong>floor</strong> function, the <strong>ceiling</strong>
function, and the <strong>round</strong> function.</p>

<p>In this task, add one of these functions to the program so that the output
will always <strong>round up</strong> from the original float value. If you need
a hint, check below!</p>

<div class="hint">
  floor(x) always rounds <strong>down</strong>. ceil(x) always rounds
    <strong>up</strong>. round(x) follows usual rounding rules.
</div>
