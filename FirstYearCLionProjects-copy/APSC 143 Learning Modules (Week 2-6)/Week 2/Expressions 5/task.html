<h3>Assignment Shorthands - Practice</h3>

<p>Now that you understand the basics of assignment shorthands, we'll try using
them in more complicated situations.</p>

<p>The provided code has the user enter two numbers, which are stored in the
variables <strong>y</strong> and <strong>z</strong>. Using assignment shorthands,
write one or more expressions that updates the value of variable <strong>x</strong>
by <strong>dividing</strong> by the <strong>sum of y and z</strong>, then <strong>
adding</strong> the value of y.</p>

<p>To complete the task, enter the values <strong>7</strong> and <strong>2
</strong> for y and z respectively into the <strong>Run</strong> terminal when
you execute the Check command.</p>

<p>If you get stuck, take a look at the hint below.</p>
