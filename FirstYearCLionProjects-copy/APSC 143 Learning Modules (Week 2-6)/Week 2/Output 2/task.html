<h2>New Line Character</h2>

<h3>What does the new line do?</h3>

<p>Why do we use the new line character on all of our output
statements? Here's a chance for you to experiment and find out for
yourself. Copy your code from the <strong>main.cpp</strong> file in
<strong>Week 2 -> Output 1</strong> and try removing the new line character
from your <strong>first</strong> output statement. Run your code and see what happens!</p>

<p>As you can see, the new line character moves the output to the next line in the
output console. However, there are some situations where this is not preferred.
To complete this task, output the following using two different
<strong>printf</strong> statements:</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to APSC 143. Computer programming is fun!</strong></p>

<p>Make sure to use a new line character on the last statement.</p>

<div class="hint">
  Make sure you include a space character at the end of your first printf function.
