<h2>Variables Example</h2>

<h3>Char Type Variables</h3>

<p>For the next step, we want to change the example code to output a <strong>char</strong> type
    variable, which is any single character, instead of an int type. You will
    have to change the type and value of x, as well as the format specifier in
    the printf function.</p>

<p>Change the code to output the following:</p>

<p><strong>x = q</strong></p>

<div class="hint">
    The value for a char type is initialized using single quotes around the
    desired character. For example, <strong>'@'</strong>.
</div>

<div class="hint">
    The format specifier for a char type is <strong>%c</strong>.
</div>
