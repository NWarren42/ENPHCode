<h2>Expressions</h2>

<h3>Product of Two Values</h3>

<p>One of the most useful features of computer programming is the ability to program
mathematical expressions. The next few tasks will have you work through some simpler
operations.</p>

<p>For this task, declare a float value <strong>z</strong> that is initialized as
the product of x and y. If done correctly, you will get the following output:</p>

<p><strong>The product of 2.48 and 6.07 is 15.05</strong></p>

<p>Keep in mind that we could just as easily use a <strong>scanf</strong> function to
ask the user for the two factors, to make the program more robust. This will be useful
in the coming assignments.</p>
