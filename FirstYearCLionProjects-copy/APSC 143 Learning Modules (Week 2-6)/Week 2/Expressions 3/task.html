<h3>Variable Incrementation</h3>

<p>Incrementation is incredibly useful in many programming scenarios, such as
keeping count of something or making iterations of a section of code (more on
that in week 4). For now, let's examine the differences between pre-increment
and post-increment using an int variable <strong>x</strong>.</p>

<p>Try running the program and see what the resulting values for x are. Does
it make sense? The postincrement x changes only <strong>after</strong> the
output statement, while the preincrement x will change <strong>before</strong>
the output statement is executed.</p>

<p>Try switching the order of the two printf functions to see how the resulting
values changes. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of incrementation,
or even deincrementation (<strong>x-- or --x</strong>).</p>

<p>Incrementation also works on <strong>char</strong> type variables! Try changing
x to a char with any letter value, and see what the result is.</p>
