<h3>Average of Three Values</h3>

<p>Another useful computation to know how to program is an average of a set of
values (it will be important for the assignments). For this example, write a
program that will take the average of three int variables.</p>

<p>The variables have already been initialized for you. Remember that the result
may not be a whole number! If you compute the average correctly, you will get
the following output:</p>

<p><strong>The average of 14, 6, and 30 is 16.67</strong></p>

<p>The hint below can help if your result is not as you expected.</p>

<div class="hint">
  When dividing by 3 to find the average, instead use 3.0 to avoid a truncation issue.
