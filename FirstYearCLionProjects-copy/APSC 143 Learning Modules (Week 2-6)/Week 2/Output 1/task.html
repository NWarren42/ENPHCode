<h2>Output Statements</h2>

<p>Next, we'll write our own <strong>printf</strong> statements. There are
  two comments inside the main loop that we want to replace.
  Try to write a pair of statements that output:</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to APSC 143.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Computer programming is fun!</strong></p>

<p>Make sure you add an include statement, and also print a new line character at the
end of each! If you are stuck, take a look at the hint below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  printf("text here!\n");
</div>

<p>This task, along with most following tasks, will test your code against a
sample solution to see if you got it right. Run the program using the <strong>
Check</strong> button below to see if your code is correct. If not, you can use
the <strong>peek solution</strong> option to compare your code with the sample
solution, or the <strong>compare output</strong> option to see how your output
differs from the expected output.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that when you use the <strong>Check</strong> button, any output
that occurs will be displayed in the <strong>Run</strong> tab of the bottom panel,
which is called a <strong>terminal window</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to run your code <strong>without</strong> comparing it
with the sample solution, you can still use the green play button that appears
on the left hand side of your code. This is a useful tool for experimenting with
your code to see what its limitations are.</p>
