<h2>Introduction to Variables</h2>

<p>This example code shows the declaration and initialization of an
integer type variable called <strong>x</strong>. It also outputs the
value of x using the printf function. Note how the <strong>%d</strong>
format specifier is used as a placeholder in the output for the value
of x.</p>

<p>Feel free to experiment with this code and see how the output changes.
Though the <strong>Check</strong> button will verify you have completed
the task, you will need to run the code with the green play button to see
how it works.</p>
