<h2>Nested Loops</h2>

<p>From the last few examples, you have already seen how we can nest selection
structures within loops. In fact, we can also nest loops within selection
structures, or even loops within loops! This task will investigate the latter.</p>

<p>This task will have you write a nested loop that, based on the int variable
<strong>upTo</strong> provided by the user, will compute all of the <strong>
factors</strong> of <strong>each value</strong> from <strong>1 to upTo</strong>.
The below description should provide some insight on how to set
up the structure of the program.</p>

<p>The outer loop should iterate from <strong>upTo</strong> to <strong>1</strong>
inclusive (ie. de-incrementing), and use <strong>upTo</strong> as the loop
counter. Therefore, as you iterate the value of upTo will decrease (see <strong>
Hint 1</strong> and/or <strong>Hint 2</strong>). Within each iteration:</p>

<ul>Output the value of upTo, using the following format where <strong>x</strong>
substitutes the value of upTo (including a new line, see <strong>Hint 3</strong>):</ul>

<ul><strong>Factors of x:</strong></ul>

<ul>Then, write an inner loop that iterates from <strong>1 to upTo</strong>.
Within each iteration:</ul>

<ul><ul>If <strong>upTo</strong> is divisible by the <strong>inner loop counter
</strong>, then print the value of the inner loop counter. For example, if upTo
divided by 3 is a whole number, then output the value 3 followed by a single
space (DO NOT print a new line here, see <strong>Hint 4</strong>).</ul></ul>

<ul>After the inner loop, print a new line.</ul>

<p>As this is confusing, reviewing the hints is encouraged. To complete this task,
input the value <strong>14</strong> when prompted.</p>

<strong> Developer's note: 'i' is declared outside of the loops to be used to
check if your answer is correct. Therefore, you must use 'i' as your variable in
the nested loop, but do not have to redeclare it.</strong>

<div class="hint">
    while (upTo is positive) { ... de-increment upTo; }
</div>

<div class="hint">
    for(upTo; upTo is positive; de-increment upTo) { ... }
</div>

<div class="hint">
    print <strong>"Factors of %d:\n"</strong> with the value of upTo.
</div>

<div class="hint">
    if (upTo is divisible by i) { print "i " }
</div>
