<h2>For Loops</h2>

<p>The other type of repetition structure, the <strong>for loop</strong>, is
incredibly useful in any number of situations; particularly those that require a
set of code to run a <strong>specified number of times</strong>.</p>

<p>The example code shows a simple for loop used alongside a scanf function. The
program asks for a number of loops from the user, then runs the code contained in
the for loop that many times. Try entering some different values (using the window
of the Run tab) and see how it works.</p>

<p>Notice how the printf function in the loop uses <strong>i + 1</strong> as the
loop number (since we set i to an initial value of 0). Therefore, i will take on
the values <strong>0 to loops - 1</strong> as the loop iterates.</p>

<p>Once you feel comfortable with the "arguments" and setup of the for loop, move
to the next task where you will transform a while loop into a for loop!</p>
