<h2>Continue Statements</h2>

<p>This command is used in a similar manner to <strong>break</strong>,
but will <strong>end the current iteration</strong> instead of stopping the loop
completely.</p>

<p>The provided code will print each letter of the alphabet on a single line.
However, you will notice that the first printf function indicates that the program
outputs <strong>consonants only</strong>.</p>

<p>For this task, write some code inside the for loop that will <strong>use the
continue command</strong> to <strong>prevent</strong> the loop from printing any
<strong>vowels</strong>. Count 'y' as a vowel. If you get stuck, take a look at
the hint below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  if(key equals a vowel) { continue; }
</div>

<p>The continue command can be useful in loops such as this for skipping over
certain conditions within the loop, without having to stop the loop and start
a new one.</p>
