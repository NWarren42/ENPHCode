<h2>The Break Function</h2>

<p>Another way to exit a loop <strong>without</strong> triggering its exit
condition is by using a <strong>break function</strong>. This will generally
allow us to use one or more additional exit conditions.</p>

<p>To begin, take a look at the provided code which simulates paying off debt
over 12 months. On each iteration of the loop, the remaining debt accumulates
interest, then the payment is made toward paying off the remaining debt.</p>

<p>While this is functioning code, there is a logic error. Try running the code;
you will see that the debt becomes negative and payments continue to be made.
How can this be fixed?</p>

<p>Write a condition inside the for loop that will <strong>stop the loop</strong>
once the debt has <strong>reached 0</strong>. If you need help, check the hints
below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  if(payment is greater than or equal to debt) { ... }
</div>

<div class="hint">
  inside the condition: set the debt to zero, then break;
</div>
