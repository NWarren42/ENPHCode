<h2>For Loops</h2>

<p>This should look familiar! Just like in <strong>Do While Loops 1</strong>, we
will take the same looping situation from <strong>While Loops 2</strong> and
convert it to a for loop with the same functionality.</p>

<p>As a refresher: this for loop should iterate using <strong>count</strong>, and
exit once <strong>total</strong> has reached 100 or greater. On each iteration,
the value of count will be added to total.</p>

<p>Copy the loop code from either of the two tasks listed above into the placeholder
and rewrite it to use a for loop instead. If you need help, take a look at the hint below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  for(count; total is less than 100; increment count) { ... }
</div>

<p>Like the previous two, you should get the identical output of: <strong>Loop ran 15
times.</strong> As shown, for loops can be used as more than just a counter of a certain
number of iterations. However, keep in mind that any for loop can be replaced by a
while loop, though this can often end up quite complex.</p>
