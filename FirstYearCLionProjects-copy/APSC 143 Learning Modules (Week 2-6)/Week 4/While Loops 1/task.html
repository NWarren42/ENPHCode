<h2>While Loops</h2>

<p>Welcome to week 4! This week's module will be diving into repetition structures
and their many uses.</p>

<p>This first example shows a <strong>while loop</strong> that uses an int value
called <strong>key</strong> to determine how many times the code will loop for.
On each iteration, the program takes an integer from the user to add to a total
and store in key. Once the user enters <strong>0</strong>, the program outputs the
total and ends.</p>

<p>Try running the code and entering some values, including negatives! Once you
have a good understanding of the code, feel free to experiment with the exit
condition or other aspects.</p>
