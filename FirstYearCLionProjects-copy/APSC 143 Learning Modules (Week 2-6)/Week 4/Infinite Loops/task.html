<h2>Infinite Loops</h2>

<p>One of the more common mistakes when programming repetition structures is to
accidentally create an <strong>infinite loop</strong>, where the exit condition
is not reachable. Naturally, this causes your code to run indefinitely until
stopped manually.</p>

<p>The example code, which simulates exponential decay, displays such an example
of an infinite loop. On each iteration, the population variable <strong>pop
</strong> is updated by multiplying
itself by <strong>0.99^i</strong>, where i is the loop counter variable.</p>

<p>To fix this problem, think about the population variable as representing the
population of a city or town - the loop should exit when there is no one left in
the population. The hint should help if you're still confused.</p>

<div class="hint">
  If the population is less than 1, there is no one left so we should stop looping.
</div>

<p>Note that there is no Peek Solution for this task. Whenever you write a new
loop, make sure an exit condition is always reachable!</p>
