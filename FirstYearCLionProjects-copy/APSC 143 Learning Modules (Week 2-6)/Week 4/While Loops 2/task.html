<h2>While Loops</h2>

<p>This example will have you write your own while loop.</p>

<p>The provided code declares two int type variables: <strong>count</strong>,
which holds the number of loop iterations, and <strong>total</strong>, which
stores the sum of all the values of count. Write a while loop that does the
following:</p>

<ul>On each iteration, add the value of count to <strong>total</strong>. Then,
increment <strong>count</strong> by 1.</ul>

<ul>Exit the loop once total has a value of <strong>100 or greater</strong>.</ul>

<p>When done correctly, you will get the output: <strong>Loop ran 15 times.
</strong></p>

<p>As always, you are encouraged to experiment with different exit conditions
or iteration components. If you get stuck, take a look at the hint below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  inside the loop: { count++; total += count; }
</div>
