<h2>Do-While Loops</h2>

<h3>Comparison to While Loops</h3>

<p>This task will investigate an example of an edge case which sets these
two loops apart: when the exit condition for both loops trigger immediately.
</p>

<p>You will have to write both a while loop and a do-while loop for this task,
which will both have identical operations.
The provided code has an integer <strong>x</strong> and 2 counting variables:
<strong>whileCount</strong> for the while loop, and <strong>doCount</strong>
for the do-while loop. Both loops will have the following properties:</p>

<ul>Inside the loop, <strong>increment</strong> the counting variable. Then,
<strong>update</strong> the value of x to be <strong>half its current
value</strong>.</ul>

<ul>The loop should run if x is an even value.</ul>

<p>If you need help putting the loops together, see the hints below. When you
run the code, the following output should occur:</p>

<p><strong>While loop ran 0 times.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do-while loop ran 2 times.</strong></p>

<p>Does this output make sense? You are encouraged to experiment and see why
the difference between the two loops is so significant here. Can you think of
another example where a do-while loop would be preferable?</p>

<div class="hint">
  while (x is even) { increment whileCount; x /= 2; }
</div>

<div class="hint">
  do { increment doCount; x /= 2; } while (x is even);
</div>
