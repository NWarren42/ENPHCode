<h2>Do-While Loops</h2>

<p>Do-while loops are used in the same way as while loops, but guarantee <strong>
at least one iteration</strong> of the contained code.</p>

<p>For this task, you will convert the last task's while loop into a do-while
loop. Copy the code from <strong>Week 4 -> While Loops 2</strong> into this
task's main function. Then, rearrange the while loop so that it operates as a
do-while loop.</p>

<div class="hint">
  do { ... } while(total is less than 100);
</div>

<p>When run, the output should be identical to the last task: <strong>Loop ran 15
times.</strong> As you can see, the do-while loop usually operates identically to
a while loop <strong>unless</strong> the exit condition would trigger instantly.
We'll investigate this more in the next task.</p>
