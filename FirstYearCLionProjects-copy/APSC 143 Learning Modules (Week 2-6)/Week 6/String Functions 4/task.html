<h2>The strcat Function</h2>

<p>This function allows us to <strong>combine 2 strings together</strong> by adding
one string onto the end of the other. Let's explore its uses!</p>

<p>The <strong>array of strings</strong> called <strong>options</strong> is a
collection of strings to be stitched together by the program. The string <strong>
sentence</strong> will hold all the chosen words. Your task is to write code within
the while loop that will:</p>

<ul>Read an integer into the variable <strong>index</strong>, which represents which
word should next be added to sentence;</ul>

<ul>Check if the index is invalid (if invalid, break the loop);</ul>

<ul>Using the <strong>strcat</strong> function, add the corresponding word in options
to the sentence string.</ul>

<p>If you get stuck, take a look at the hint below. To complete the task, enter the 
necessary index values so that the printf function outputs the following:</p>

<p><strong>a green lobster will dig the lecture</strong></p>

<div class="hint">
  strcat(s1, s2) will add s2 onto the end of s1.
</div>

Once you complete this task, the console will print a password for you to use to access the <strong>
