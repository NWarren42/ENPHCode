<h2>String Initialization</h2>

<p>There is a final way we can initialize strings, which is significantly
easier than the others: omit the array length and use <strong>" "</strong>
around the string.</p>

<p>This example finds the largest and smallest letters found in the string
<strong>word</strong>. Initialize word to hold "<strong>watermelon</strong>".
Then, declare and initialize two char variables <strong>min</strong> and <strong>
max</strong> to hold the largest and smallest letters.</p>

<p>You will need to create a loop to check each element in word and update min
and max by comparing to each element. If you get stuck, take a look at the hints
below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  Set the initial value of min and max to the first character in word.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  The loop should run from index 0 to the length of the word - 1. Inside, check
    if the current element is smaller than min, and if it's larger than max.
</div>

<p>While each initialization method is useful in different situations, choose the
method you like the best and stick with it!</p>
