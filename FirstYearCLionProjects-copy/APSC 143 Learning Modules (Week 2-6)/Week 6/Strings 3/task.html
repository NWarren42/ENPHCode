<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>Like any array, strings can have their elements individually reassigned. This
task provides a fun example through user input.</p>

<p>This example uses an "infinite" loop that will modify the string <strong>
boggle</strong> based on the index and new letter input by the user. Write code
to perform the following:</p>

<ul>Declare the string <strong>boggle</strong> and initialize it to hold the word
"<strong>banked</strong>".</ul>

<ul>Check if the value for <strong>pos</strong> is a valid index: If true, replace
the letter at the chosen index with the new letter, <strong>key</strong>.</ul>

<p>To complete the task, input the following combinations in tis order:</p>

<table width="60%">
    <tr>
        <td>3 d</td>
        <td>0 r</td>
        <td>2 d</td>
        <td>1 i</td>
        <td>5 n</td>
        <td>8 y</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>If you need help, take a look at the hints below. Feel free to experiment
with different entries and see what you get!</p>

<div class="hint">
  The index needs to be between 0 and the length of the word.
