<h2>String Initialization</h2>

<p>Welcome to week 6! We'll be going over strings and their many uses.
A <strong>string</strong> is a 1D array of chars that has some special
properties which set it apart from other arrays. The next tasks will investigate
this!</p>

<p>Strings can be initialized on one line, like other arrays; however, they
require an additional null character, <strong>\0</strong>, at the end of the array.
Initialize the string <strong>word</strong> with each individual character in
"<strong>pear</strong>".</p>

<p>The program has also defined the variable <strong>average</strong>. Write some
code that will find the average value of each letter (<strong>excluding</strong>
the null character) in the array. The variable <strong>wordsize</strong> has been
created so that you can easily find the length of the word (excluding the null
character).</p>

<p>Lastly, you will need to output word, which can be done using a single printf
statement. Use the below format for the printf statement.
Check the hints if you need any help.</p>

<p><strong>Word = "pear"</strong></p>

<div class="hint">
  char identifier[size] = {'a', 'b', ... '\0'};
</div>

<div class="hint">
  Your for loop should run from 0 to wordsize - 1, inclusive.
</div>


<div class="hint">
  Strings can be printed using the <strong>%s</strong> format specifier.
</div>
