<h2>String Input</h2>

<p>This and the following 2 tasks go over the ways a string can be initialized with user
input. Like other arrays, using a loop to initialize element-by-element works; however, this
is pretty inefficient. We can alternatively scan an
entire string at once using its format specifier, <strong>%s</strong>.</p>

<p>The example code has defined the string <strong>word</strong> that reads an 8-letter word
from the user with a scanf function. Notice how the scanf argument of word can <strong>omit
the &</strong> symbol! Let's test its limitations.</p>

<p>First, try entering a word that is <strong>less</strong> than 8 letters. Next, try a word
that is <strong>greater</strong> than 9 letters long. Do both work the way you expected?</p>

<p>While it seems like this method can work for any size string, it actually causes some
memory storage issues that we'll learn more about later. The next task goes over another method
that circumvents this problem!</p>
