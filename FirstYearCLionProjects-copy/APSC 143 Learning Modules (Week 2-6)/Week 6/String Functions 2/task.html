<h2>The strcpy Function</h2>

<p>This function can be used to copy one string into the memory of another
- which has a similar use to <strong>memcpy</strong>.</p>

<p>This task is centred around the <strong>array of strings</strong> called
<strong>list</strong>, which holds 6 names on it. Using a while loop, the
user is prompted to enter two indexes to swap in the list (e.g. swapping
0 and 1 would put "Bill" before "Charlie"). If they enter invalid indexes
or the same index twice, the loop ends and the final list is printed.</p>

<p>Your task is to use the strcpy function to <strong>swap</strong> the names
of the two indexes entered by the user. The string <strong>temp</strong> has
been declared to help with this. Be careful about overwriting the names! If
you need help, take a look at the hint below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  Copy the x name to temp -> copy the y name to x -> copy the temp name to y
</div>

<p>To complete the task, make 2 swaps so that the list is in alphabetical
order before entering an invalid input.</p>
