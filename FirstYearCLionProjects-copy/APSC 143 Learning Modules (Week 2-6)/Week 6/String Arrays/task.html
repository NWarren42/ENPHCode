<h2>Arrays of Strings</h2>

<p>When using strings, a 2-dimensional array essentially becomes a 1-dimensional
<strong>array of strings</strong> - since one of the dimensions holds the letters
making up the strings.
This task will dive into how we use these more comprehensibly.</p>

<p>The example code uses a string array called <strong>list</strong>.
Declare this array, and store the following 6 strings in this order:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>giraffe</td>
        <td>elegance</td>
        <td>osmosis</td>
        <td>universal</td>
        <td>victorian</td>
        <td>romania</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The rest of the program iterates through the array, printing each string and
the string <strong>in reverse</strong>. The strings are printed in order. The
forward and reverse versions are separated by a <strong>single space</strong>.
You will need to write a statement that will print each char in the string
in reverse order.</p>

<p>Don't forget about our new favourite function <strong>strlen</strong>! If you
get stuck, check out the hints below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  Example string array: char names[2][10] = {"Angela", "Muhammad"};
</div>

<div class="hint">
  You can indicate the current char like in a normal 2D array: list[word index][letter index]
</div>

<p>As you will see in the next few tasks, string arrays can be just as useful
as any other array! We'll investigate other ways to create string arrays in later
weeks.</p>
