<h2>The strlen Function</h2>

<p>It's a pretty big pain to write <strong>sizeof(word) / sizeof(word[0])</strong>
every time we need the length of the string, isn't it? Fortunately, there's a
function that will find the length for us!</p>

<p>This code should look familiar: for this task, determine the average letter of
the string <strong>word</strong> (you can use most of your code from <strong>Strings
1</strong>). However, instead of using sizeof to find the length of word, use
the <strong>strlen</strong> function instead.</p>

<p>This function takes a string as its argument and returns its length, <strong>
excluding</strong> the null character. It's incredibly useful! You just need to
include the <strong>string library</strong> in your code.</p>

<div class="hint">
  Your loop runs from index 0 to strlen(word) - 1.

<div class="hint">
  Divide the sum by strlen(word) to get the average.
