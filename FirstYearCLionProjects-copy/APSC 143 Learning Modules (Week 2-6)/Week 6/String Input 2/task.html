<h2>String Input</h2>

<p>Using the same example, this program prompts the user for an 8-letter word and reads it
into the string <strong>word</strong>. However, there is one key difference that solves our
previous memory issues - the format specifier.</p>

<p>Because we want an 8-letter word, the scanf argument uses the format specifier <strong>
%8s</strong>, permitting only 8 characters (excluding the null character) to be read into
word. Again, let's test the limitations of this updated method.</p>

<p>First enter a word that is<strong>less</strong> than 8 letters, and then a word that is
<strong>more</strong> than 8 letters. You can see that the longer word has been <strong>cut
off</strong> at the 8 letter mark!</p>

<p>However, this method still has 1 flaw. Change the length of word to a large value (at least
30) and input a sentence. Now we have another, slightly different problem!</p>
