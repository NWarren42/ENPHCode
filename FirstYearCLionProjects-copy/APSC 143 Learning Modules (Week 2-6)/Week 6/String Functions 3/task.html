<h2>The strcmp Function</h2>

<p>Another useful function, <strong>strcmp</strong>, compares two strings alphabetically
by returning an int value representing whether the first string comes before, comes after,
or is the same as the second string.</p>

<p>The provided code declares two strings: <strong>test</strong>, which is initialized
as "tangerine"; and <strong>user</strong>, which will store a string entered by the user.
Depending what was entered, the rest of the program will print which word comes first in
the dictionary.</p>

<p>Create an int type variable that stores the strcmp of test and user. Based on its value,
finish the if-else block so that the correct message will be printed. If you get stuck,
take a look at the hint below.</p>

<p>To complete the task, enter the word "<strong>camel</strong>" when prompted.</p>

<div class="hint">
  strcmp(test, user) will return < 0 if test comes <strong>before</strong> user.
</div>

<p>Feel free to test this function with <strong>capital letters</strong> and see what
happens! (Look up an ASCII table if you want to know why this occurs.)
This function is particularly useful when you need to put a collection of
strings in alphabetical order - as we'll see next week!</p>

<p>Once you complete this task, the console will print a password for you to use to
