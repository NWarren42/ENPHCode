<h2>1-Dimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>In this example, we'll use a loop to help us initialize an array. This can allow
us to choose individual numbers for each value.</p>

<p>This example uses a float type array <strong>nums</strong> of size <strong>
LENGTH</strong>(allowing us to modify the array size easily). You will have to declare
this array . Each element of nums will be entered separately by the user.</p>

<p>Write a loop that will iterate through each <strong>index</strong> of nums. On
each iteration, get a float value from the user using <strong>scanf</strong> and
store it in the corresponding index of nums. Look at the printf loop for help - yours
should end up very similar!</p>

<p>To complete this task, enter the five numbers shown below. If you get stuck,
take a look at the hints below.</p>

<table width="60%">
  <tr>
    <td>3.68</td>
    <td>77.10</td>
    <td>84.90</td>
    <td>2.00</td>
    <td>15.41</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This assignment method can also be used for
mathematical situations, such as storing cartesian coordinates of a function.</p>

<div class="hint">
  for (int i from 0 to LENGTH-1; i++) { scan float into nums at index i }
</div>
