<h2>1-Dimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>Welcome to week 5! This week's module looks at arrays, an incredibly useful structure for
programming.</p>

<p>This example uses an int type array called <strong>ray</strong>, which holds <strong>5
</strong> integers. Each value will be printed using the provided printf function. The
values are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>87, 12, 63, 101, 20</strong></p>

<p>To complete this task, declare the array and initialize all of its values <strong>on
the same line</strong>. If you need help, take a look at the hint below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  int identifier[size] = {val1, val2, ...};
</div>

<p>This method of array initialization is easy, as long as you <strong>know all the values
</strong> when you declare it.</p>
