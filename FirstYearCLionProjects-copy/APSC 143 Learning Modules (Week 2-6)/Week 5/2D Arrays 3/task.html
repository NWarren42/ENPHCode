<h2>2-Dimensional Arrays</h2>

<h3>Copying Arrays</h3>

<p>If we want to add additional elements to a full array, the only way to do so
is to create a new, larger array and copy all of the elements over. This task
will go over the two ways to perform this.</p>

<p>The original array, <strong>wave1</strong>, holds time values in its first row
and positions of the sine wave in its second row (based on the first row times).
All contents of wave1 have been copied into <strong>wave2</strong> using a for
loop, which also has a third row containing the cosine wave along the same domain.
</p>

<p>For this task, create a third array called <strong>wave3</strong> that will
store all the data from wave2 - copy this using <strong>memcpy</strong>. This array
will also have a fourth row, to hold the tangent wave along the same domain. When
completed, your output will look like this:</p>

<table width="70%">
    <tr>
        <td>x</td>
        <td>sin</td>
        <td>cos</td>
        <td>tan</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0.000</td>
        <td>0.000</td>
        <td>1.000</td>
        <td>0.000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1.047</td>
        <td>0.866</td>
        <td>0.500</td>
        <td>1.732</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Take note on how the <strong>sizeof</strong> function is used; the memory of one
row is divided by the memory of one element to find the elements in a row.</p>

<p>Copying arrays is a useful tool; choose whichever method you prefer, and
master it! (But remember that memcpy can only be used when adding extra <strong>
rows</strong>)</p>

<div class="hint">
  memcpy(bigger array, smaller array, size of smaller array);
</div>
