<h2>2-Dimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>2-dimensional arrays can also be initialized element-by-element using a nested loop,
where each loop counter references either the row or column position in the array. This
task will explore this idea.</p>

<p>The starter code has defined a 2D array called <strong>timesTable</strong> of size
12x12, which will hold a multiplication table from 1 to 12.
Complete the nested loop code to initialize all elements in the array, so that they
follow the following format:</p>

<table width="200px">
    <tr>
        <td width="50">1</td>
        <td width="50">2</td>
        <td width="50">3</td>
        <td width="50">4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>12</td>
        <td>16</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Keep in mind that your loop counter variables will be named <strong>row</strong> and
<strong>col</strong>; you will need to determine which should be in which loop. Also, remember
that the array indexes start at <strong>0</strong>, but our multiplications should start at
<strong>1</strong>. The hints below will answer these problems.</p>

<p>Note how the nested loop is written for both initialization and output!
We also see the advantage of using <strong>#define</strong> here: the size of our table
can easily be modified with one small change. Try experimenting with resizing the array and different expressions for assigning
each element!</p>

<div class="hint">
  Your outer loop should iterate through rows; that way, you can print each element
    that belongs on the same line as you go.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  If both your loops iterate from 0 to 11, the current element should store (row+1) * (col+1).
</div>
