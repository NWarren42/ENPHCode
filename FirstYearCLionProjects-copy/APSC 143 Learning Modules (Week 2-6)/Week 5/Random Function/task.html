<h2>The Random Function</h2>

<p>Now let's use arrays to introduce a new function: <strong>rand()</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>rand()</strong> will return an integer value that is between 0 and
a very large value. Generally, we want a value in a specific domain, which can
be generated with the following expression:</p>

<p><strong>int x = rand() % (max - min + 1) + min;</strong></p>

<p>where <strong>max</strong> is the largest value of the domain and <strong>min
</strong> is the smallest. The modulus operator will restrict the value to a certain
range, while the min addition will translate the range to the desired domain.</p>

<p>For testing purposes, we <strong>seed</strong> the random function so that
it returns the same random values each run. To do this, call <strong>srand(int)
</strong> before any rand() calls are used. Use <strong>2</strong> as the argument.</p>

<p>Both of these functions are part of the <strong>standard library</strong>. You can
include it with the tag <strong>stdlib.h</strong>.</p>

<p>For this task, you will be generating a number of random integers equal to <strong>
TRIALS</strong>. These integers will have the domain [1, 50], which is represented by
<strong>SIZE</strong>. You will track the <strong>number of times</strong> a given value
has been generated using the <strong>distribute</strong> array; the first element of
distribute (index 0) will count how many 1's appear, and so on.</p>

<p>Code the following into the for loop:</p>

<ul>Generate a random value in the domain [1, 50] and store it in <strong>
randoms</strong>;</ul>
<ul>Increment the element of <strong>distribute</strong> that is associated with
that value.</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that the index of distribute does not quite line up with the generated
value. See the hint if you get stuck! You are encouraged to experiment with the
function, as you should be comfortable with it when you work on the assignment.</p>

  You can increment the correct element by using distribute[randoms - min]
