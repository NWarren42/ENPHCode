<h2>2-Dimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>Arrays with 2 or more dimensions can be used in the same ways as their
1-dimensional counterparts, but allow for better organization of their respective
variables. Using multidimensional arrays can also be slightly more complex, as we're
about to see!</p>

<p>The provided code has declared a 2-dimensional array called <strong>nums</strong>.
Initialize it to hold the following values, using a single line of code:</p>

<table width="50%">
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>19</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>22</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>23</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>13</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>14</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>27</td>
        <td>8</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The code also includes a nested for loop that iterates through each element of
the array (make sure you understand how this works). Inside this nested loop, write
a printf function to output the current element followed by a tab character, <strong>
\t</strong>. Notice how we have the new line on its own! This will separate each
row.</p>

<p>The next task will look into another way to initialize multidimensional arrays,
using a nested for loop.</p>

<div class="hint">
  When initializing a 2D array, use { } to separate each row with commas between
    them.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  The current element in the nested loop can be accessed using nums[row][col].
</div>
