<h2>1-Dimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>Since arrays are typically a list of related values, it's natural to use them to
analyze the elements as a collective - for instance, taking an average of all the
elements. This example will delve into some useful computations we can conduct on
array elements.</p>

<p>The provided code defines the float array <strong>vals</strong> with 6 elements.
Your task will be to find the <strong>sum of all the elements</strong>, as well as
the <strong>minimum value</strong> in the array. You will have to declare and
initialize variables for <strong>sum</strong> and <strong>min</strong>, as well as
a loop to iterate through the array.</p>

<p>Your loop should, on each iteration: add the current element to sum; and
check whether the current element is less than the current min value (if true,
then update min to be equal to the current element). If you get stuck, take a look
at the hints below.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <strong>min</strong> should be initialized to the first value of the array.
</div>

<div class="hint">
  for(int i from 0 to SIZE-1) { add vals[i] to sum; if vals[i] is larger than min, update min }
</div>
